# Overview
DevHub is a proxy hub, mostly meant to be a fast one stop shop for a high speed proxy

# How does it work?
Using wildcard domains, you can type any letters without spaces and add ".darianm.com" and go to the privately hosted DevHub that runs 24/7

# How to setup pls pls explain i want to host!!
Download node.js, NPM, and git. Then download/clone the repository and run "npm install". After the packagaes are done downloading, either run "node index.js" or "npm start". You can modify the port in the index.js file.
